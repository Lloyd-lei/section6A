Section Participation and Submission Guidelines
Section attendance is required , but you do not need to complete all the
work during the section. At each section, the TA will answer any questions that
you might have, and you are encouraged to work with others and look for online
resources during the section and outside of sections. Unless otherwise stated,
the work will be due one week from the time of assignment. The TA will give
you 1 point for each task completed. You can see your grades on Canvas.
We will use GitHub for section worksheet submissions. By the due date,
you should have a single public repository on GitHub containing all the work
you have done for the section work. Finally, upload a screenshot or a .txt file
to Canvas with your GitHub username and repository name so the TA knows
who you are and which repository you are using for the section.
Remember: talk to your fellow students, work together, and use
GPTs. You will find it much easier than working alone. Good luck!
All work should be done in the Docker container, and don’t forget to
commit it to Git!
Task 1: Poisson
Consider an example in astrophysics. Let’s assume stars randomly distributed
around us with density n, what is probability that the nearest star is at distance
R?
Task 2: Lorentzian
Resonance behavior is critical for understanding the energy dissipation and ab-
sorption of a system. Let’s consider a general dissipative, driven harmonic
oscillator in both time and frequency domain,
d2x
dt2+γdx
dt+ω2
0x=Feiωft,−ω2˜x+iγω˜x+ω2
0˜x=Fδ(ω−ωf),(1)

where ˜ xandxare related via Fourier transform. Show that the energy absorp-
tion per cycle is a Lorentzian,
E=Fπγωf
(ω2
0−ω2
f)2+γ2ω2
f. (2)
Hint: sin(Σ) = −Aγω f.
Task 2: Revisit the Heisenberg XXX Hamilto-
nian on a Ring: Markov Chain
In the previous section, we have looked at the Heisenberg XXX Hamiltonian
spectrum on a ring using various matrix techniques. In this task, you are asked
to construct the Markov chain that simulate
Let us introduce the raising and lowering operators S±=Sx±iSy, such
that
S+| ↑⟩= 0, S−| ↑⟩=| ↓⟩, S z| ↑⟩=1
2| ↑⟩
S+| ↓⟩=| ↑⟩, S−| ↓⟩= 0, S z| ↓⟩=−1
2| ↓⟩. (4)
We can write the XXX Hamiltonian as the following,
H=JN
4−JNX
i=11
2(S+iS−i+1+S−iS+i+1) +SziSzi+1, (5)
with periodic boundary condition, such that N+ 1 = 1.
Let us look at the different terms. The terms involving S±are called hopping
terms since they move a spin up or spin down to a neighboring site. The constant
term proportional to Nis added for convenience. It is simply an overall shift
of the energy levels. Depending on the sign, you want to align or anti-align the
spins, i.e. (anti-)ferromagnetism.
The above Hamiltonian can be written in a matrix form with a given Hilbert
space. let’s consider a simple 3-spin chain, where the index location represents
the sites, i.e. 1 ,2,3. The Hamiltonian for the Heisenberg XXX model with
N= 3 spins is given by,
H=3J
4−J"
1
2(S+1S−2+S−1S+2)+Sz1Sz2+1
2(S+2S−3+S−2S+3)+Sz2Sz3+1
2(S+3S−1+S−3S+1)+Sz3Sz1#
with states,
(|↑↑↑⟩,|↑↑↓⟩,|↑↓↑⟩,|↑↓↓⟩,|↓↑↑⟩,|↓↑↓⟩,|↓↓↑⟩,|↓↓↓⟩ ).
The corresponding marginal distribution is given by,
π= (π1, π2,···, π8). (3)

For example, matrix element can be calculate via the following expression,
⟨↓↑↓| S+2S−3|↓↓↑⟩ = 1. (4)
Question 1: Markov chain in site basis
Using the above Hamiltonian, construct the Markov chain for the above N= 3
system. What are the transition probabilities? Write it in a matrix form.
Question 2: Markov chain in site basis
At a given temperature, find a stationary distribution πby solving the following
expression,
πP=π,andkX
i=1πi= 1.
Question 3: Markov chain in site basis
Use the power iteration,
πk+1=πkP
, to find the stationary distribution for the following three initial guesses,
•1) Pr(|↑↑↑⟩ ) = 1 ,
•2) Pr(|↑↑↑⟩ ) =1
2,Pr(|↓↑↓⟩ ) =1
2,
•3) a uniformly distributed initial configuration.
Question 4: Markov chain in magnon basis
Let’s say we are only interested in the population probabilities (diagonal term
in the density matrix) of magnons, where we can model the transition between
magnons |k⟩ → | k′⟩classically via the classical master equation . We should
note that if the off-diagonal terms are large (represents the coherence than
number statistics), we must use the quantum master equation (Lindblad master
equation).
Recall the magnon formulation: Ground state. Since the total spin is
conserved, the state in which all spins are aligned in the same direction must
be an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. This corresponds to the ferromagnetic
vacuum. Therefore, we define the vacuum state as
|0⟩=| ↑↑. . .↑⟩.
It is straightforward to calculate the energy of this state:
H|0⟩= 0.
Themagnon (spin wave) state is defined as:
3
--- Page 4 ---
|p⟩=X
neipnS−n|0⟩
where iis the imaginary unit, S−nis the spin lowering operator at site n,
and|0⟩is the ground state. The periodic boundary condition ensures that,
eipN= 1. This ensures that the momentum are quantized,
eipn=eip(n+N)
which implies that the momentum pis quantized in units of2π
N. Thus, the
allowed values for pare:
p=2πk
N, k = 0,1,2, . . . , N −1
The energy corresponding to each allowed value of pis given by the dispersion
relation:
E(p) = 2 Jsin2p
2
Substituting the quantized values of p, we get the energy levels for the
magnon as:
Ek= 2Jsin2πk
N
, k = 0,1,2, . . . , N −1
ForN= 3 case, in the basis of magnon, write the Markov chain associated
with transitions between magnons. You can assume Boltzmann type transition
between magnons, where the elements of Phave the form:
Pij∼e−(Ek−Ek′)/kBT.
Remember, in the ring configuration, the energy is at maximum at k=N/2
because this is the case where exactly half of the spins are flip. What are the
difference between transition matrices in site basis and in magnon basis?
Question 5: Markov chain in magnon basis
Again, at a given temperature, find a stationary distribution πby solving the
following expression,
πP=π,andkX
i=1πi= 1.
How does the stationary distribution of magnon changes as you increase the
temperature? What are the similarities and difference from the site basis above?
Remember, you are in the magnon basis.

Question 6: Markov chain in magnon basis
Use the power iteration,
πk+1=πkP
, to find the stationary distribution for the following three initial guesses,
•1) Pr(|k= 1⟩) = 1 ,
•2) Pr(|k= 1⟩) =1
2,Pr(|k= 4⟩) =1
2,
•3) a uniformly distributed initial magnon configuration.
Question 7: Master equation evolution
The classical master equation in continuous time takes the general form,
dπi
dt=X
j(Qjiπj−Qjiπi).
Convert the previous transition matrix Pinto the transition rate matrix Q
numerically. Be careful on the “time” definition when you use Pn. Hint: try to
fixn, and find the relation with respect to t∼n∆t,
Q∼1
n∆tln(Pn). (5)
Write the linear equation in the following matrix representation,
dπ
dt=πQ, (6)
and with the initial condition Pr( |k= 1⟩) = 1, solve the above system numeri-
cally with any scipy integrator, and visualize the probability πi.
